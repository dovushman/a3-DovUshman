## Your Web Application Title

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. http://a3-joshua-cuneo.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please 
add a little more detail about what it does.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: For my technical achievements, I used heroku to host my website.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative. I met cvghjkhghjk amount of achievements. Specifically:

Writing Achievements:
- I used page titles so a user would know what website is running by looking at their browser tab
- I used headings to help organize the page 
- I provided clear instructions on how to use my app.
- I provided clear and consise insturctions that would be easy for users to follow

Design Achievements:
- I provided contrast between foreground and background. For example in my text inputs, I have place holder text which is a light grey and is clearly not typed in.
- I did not rely on color to convey information. For required information, I included an asterisk and for all of my buttons I made sure their purpose was in writing.
- I made sure all of my interactive elements had some way to be easily identified. All of my interactive components has the mouse change symbols when being hovered over.
- I provide easily identifiable feedback through alerts that tell users about minimum requirements to run my program.
- I use headings and spacing to group related content to help organize the the page.

Developing Achievements:
- Use mark-up to convey meaning and strucutre. For my code, I used different html strucutres to help organize my code and by giving them ids to keep all of the code that makes up a component together. 
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes. When an error occurs, I tell the user about minimum requirements to different fields so they can fix their inputs.
- Reflect the reading order in the code. My HTML code reflects the order items appear on the page.

- **Design Achievement 2**:
My website used the CRAP principles to help improve my website.

**Contrast:****
 The first page of my application is the login page. This page is relatively simple but did use contrasting colors. While the majority of the page was white with black text, the use of grey to outline text boxes and provide sample text are ways I try to direct the user’s attention. By making this button a vibrant blue (the only other color on the page), I hope to make it clear that this is important. On the main page, there are more essential pieces. I made any button bright blue or red to make it stand out on the white background. For the table on the side, I used alternating colors to help the user keep track of the information on a singular line.

**Repetition:**
 I used different pieces of repetition on my website to make it look cleaner. On both the login page and the main page, any inputs or buttons are the same size as the others on the page. In the table on the main page, I used a repeating color pattern to allow the user to help differentiate the different lines of the table and to help keep the page looking clean. I also used repeating patterns to make my code more usable. Above all of my text boxes, it states what the text input should be. Placeholders also show what should be entered inside the text boxes. Similarly, all of the buttons state what they do. Another location I have a repeating pattern is within my modal, within the dropdown to select who should be modified, there is a consistent order of information displayed to make repeating this process easy.

**Alignment:**
The alignment of my page was done very purposefully. First of all, on the main page, there is a header in the top center of the screen. Under this, the screen is split into left and right. The content on both sides of the screen starts at the same height. Between different components on the screen, there is a consistent gap unless the gap was purposely created to show the difference between fields and what is being asked in the second section. The table alignment was also done purposefully. I believe having a line ID first followed by a person’s first name, middle name, and last name followed by their initials is the optimal way to present this type of table. Lastly, the gap between the left and right sides was made to be large enough that it would be clear they were separate but small enough not to take up too much space and make the information look condensed.

**Proximity:**
 I used proximity on my site to keep related information together. By having the table as the entire structure on the right side of the screen, anything on the right side is part of the table. The table also has column headers, so if a user wants to look at first names, they are nicely organized. On the left side of the screen, all related items are kept together. All things related to the inputs are at the top, and the removal items are at the bottom. By having a modify button in the middle, the modified information is kept very separate in a modal where it won’t be confused with anything else. Having only the needed information available and centered on the screen makes its purpose very clear.
